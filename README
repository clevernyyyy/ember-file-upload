ember.js web app showing file uploads in action using ember-data

To run this django application

1. mkvirtualenv ember-file-upload
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python manage.py syncdb --noinput
4. python manage.py runserver
5. http://localhost:8000/
6. select 2 gif images and click the save button

The images are base64 decoded on the python/django side and dropped in the root project folder

On success look for logo.gif and other.gif

**Files of interest for anyone looking at the ember side of this project

https://github.com/toranb/ember-file-upload/blob/master/ember/static/script/app/person.js

- This file contains the ember views/controllers/models/router

https://github.com/toranb/ember-file-upload/blob/master/ember/person/templates/index.html

- This file contains the handlebars template

https://github.com/toranb/ember-file-upload/blob/master/ember/static/script/vendor/adapter.js

- This file contains the ember-data adapter that will fire off the ajax post

https://github.com/toranb/ember-file-upload/blob/master/ember/person/views.py

- This file contains the python view that responses to the http post (look for the class NewPerson)

**issues in the current release

1.) After a successful file upload you will see a JS error coming from the ember internals

"Uncaught Error: assertion failed: The server must provide a primary key: id"

- This is not an ember issue, my python view is returning html and not json (but the upload does work)

2.) This is a basic proof of concept so it's not working on IE8 but this isn't ember-data but the django-rest-framework adapter I wrote.

- You can modify the adapter file and replace the FormData element with something more IE friendly if needed

3.) This doesn't work with png images for some odd reason
